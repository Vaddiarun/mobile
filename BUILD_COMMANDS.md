# Quick Build Commands Reference

## 🚀 Build Release APK

### Step 1: Clean Previous Builds
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Build Release APK 
```bash
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

**OR using Gradle directly:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Find Your APK
```
📁 android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Step 4: Install on Device

# Crash logs only
adb logcat | grep -E "(FATAL|AndroidRuntime)"

# Save to file
adb logcat > logs.txt
```

### Clear Logs Before Testing
```bash
adb logcat -c
```

### Check Connected Devices

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:

1. **Clean everything:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
rm -rf .gradle
rm -rf app/build
cd ..
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

2. **Rebuild:**
```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### If APK Crashes:

1. **Check logs immediately after crash:**
```bash
adb logcat -d > crash.log
```

2. **Test with debug build first:**
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

3. **Compare behavior between debug and release**

## 📊 Build Analysis

### Check APK Size
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease --scan
```

### Analyze Dependencies
```bash
cd android
./gradlew app:dependencies
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Test Workflow

```bash
# 1. Clean
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

# 2. Build
npx expo run:android --variant release

# 3. Monitor
adb logcat -c && adb logcat | grep -E "(FATAL|ReactNative)"

# 4. Test QR scanning → Bluetooth → Trip config
```

---

## ⚡ Development vs Release

### Debug Build (for testing)
```bash
npx expo run:android
# or
npm run android
```

### Release Build (for production)
```bash
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

**Key Differences:**
- Debug: No obfuscation, debuggable, larger size
- Release: Obfuscated, optimized, smaller size, production-ready
