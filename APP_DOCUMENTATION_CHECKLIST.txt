3. FULL DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

Thinxlog is a professional IoT sensor management application designed for 
tracking temperature and humidity data during transportation trips. 

The app connects to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors via QR code scanning, 
allowing users to:
- Start and stop trip monitoring sessions
- Configure customer and box profiles with custom temperature/humidity thresholds
- Track real-time location data during trips
- View trip history with detailed sensor readings
- Export trip data for analysis

Ideal for cold chain logistics, pharmaceutical transport, and any 
temperature-sensitive cargo monitoring needs.

9. DATA SECURITY PRACTICES
================================================================================

ENCRYPTION IN TRANSIT:
☑ All API calls use HTTPS/TLS encryption
☑ BASE_URL: https://adfd9ywki5.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev
☑ Minimum TLS version: ### VERIFY YOUR API GATEWAY TLS VERSION (1.2 or 1.3)

ENCRYPTION AT REST:
☑ Local storage encrypted using MMKV with AES encryption
☑ Encryption key: "gndthinxloguser-341" ### CONSIDER ROTATING THIS KEY
☑ User data, trip data, and tokens stored encrypted locally

AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION:
☑ Bearer token authentication (JWT)
☑ Tokens stored in encrypted local storage
☑ Token expiration: ### SPECIFY TOKEN EXPIRATION TIME
☑ OTP verification for registration

BLUETOOTH SECURITY:
☑ BLE connections use standard Bluetooth security protocols
☑ Device pairing via QR code scanning

SERVER-SIDE SECURITY:
- API Gateway authentication
- Lambda function permissions
- Database encryption
- Access control policies
- Logging and monitoring

RECOMMENDED STATEMENT FOR GOOGLE PLAY:
"Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS 1.2+. Local data is encrypted 
at rest using AES encryption. User authentication uses secure token-based 
authentication with OTP verification. Bluetooth connections follow standard 
BLE security protocols."
